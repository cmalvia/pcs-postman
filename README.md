# Instructions on how to setup the Postman Collections and Environments relating to Prisma Cloud (including Compute Console) API requests

To use these Collections and Environment, there are a few setup pieces after importing the 4 files into Postman:
1. [Import the 4 files](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting-data/) in root of this repo (3 Collections and 1 Environment) into Postman.

1. Set some [Postman Environment variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/). You will need to set:
    1. api-endpoint
    1. compute-api-endpoint
    1. aporeto-api-enpoint
    1. namespace
    1. ACCESS_KEY
    1. SECRET_KEY

1. To get the address/URL for your Console, go to *Compute > Manage > System > Downloads*, and copy the string under **Path to Console**
**The URL should look something like this:** https://us-east1.cloud.twistlock.com/us-1-123456789
   1. You will be replacing the **compute-api-endpoint** variable

1. To get the address/URL for your Microsegmentation, click on the key icon at the bottom of any page on *Cloud Network Security
**The URL should look something like this:** https://api.east-01.network.prismacloud.io
   1. You will be replacing the **aporeto-api-endpoint** variable
   
1. Depending on what Admin console you see when you log in will determine which API Endpoint you will use. 
   1. The corresponding value below will replace the **api-endpoint** variable.


Prisma Cloud Admin Console | 	Prisma Cloud API Endpoint
------------ | -------------
https://app.prismacloud.io	| https://api.prismacloud.io
https://app2.prismacloud.io	| https://api2.prismacloud.io
https://app3.prismacloud.io	| https://api3.prismacloud.io
https://app4.prismacloud.io	| https://api4.prismacloud.io
https://app.anz.prismacloud.io	| https://api.anz.prismacloud.io
https://app.eu.prismacloud.io	| https://api.eu.prismacloud.io
https://app2.eu.prismacloud.io	| https://api2.eu.prismacloud.io
https://app.gov.prismacloud.io	| https://api.gov.prismacloud.io
https://app.prismacloud.cn	| https://api.prismacloud.cn
https://app.ca.prismacloud.io	| https://api.ca.prismacloud.io
https://app.sg.prismacloud.io	| https://api.sg.prismacloud.io

## The rest of the variables shouldn't need altered, and are either auto-generated or for future or other scenarios.
The below table shows an example of what a completed Environment should look like **before** generating any JWT tokens

Postman Variable | Use | Value/Example
------------ | ------------- | -------------
api-endpoint | Main API endpoint for Prisma Cloud requests | api.prismacloud.io
token	| JWT token auto-generated after the /login request | 
compute-api-endpoint	| API endpoint for all things within the Compute tab | https://us-east1.cloud.twistlock.com/us-1-123456789
compute-token	| JWT token auto-generated after the Compute /authenticate request | 
api-version | Used only for the Compute collection for future API versions | v1
console-port | Used only for self-hosted versions of the Compute Console | 
aporeto-api-endpoint | API endpoint for all things within the Microsegmentation tab | https://api.east-01.network.prismacloud.io
aporeto-token | JWT token auto-generated after the Microsegmentation /issue request
namespace | The namespace on CNS where you will be operating | /859889522116745232/my-cloud-account/Application

## Advanced Postman scenarios using Collection Runner

In the **Collection_Runner** folder, there are specific examples for use-cases where using Postman's Collection Runner makes sense. 

This is an easy way to iterate through files/CSVs/etc for a specific subset of API calls you want to make. More instructions in the README within [this folder](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/pcs-postman/tree/main/Collection_Runner).

## That's it! The Collections are not fully complete, so if you find a request that hasn't been created (or needs updated) please feel free to submit a PR. 

## Accessing Multiple Tenants
You can easily switch between Prisma Cloud Tenants by creating multiple Environments. To do this just import the `Prisma Cloud.postman_environment.json` file again and set the new api endpoints and credentials. Be sure to change the environment name so you can tell your environments apart!
